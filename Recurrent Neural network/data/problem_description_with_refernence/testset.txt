The input buffers on the device have shown timing sensitivity to the logic-low input voltage that can cause changes to the AC input timings. Due to this issue, input voltages must be driven at or below 0.4V to limit impact on AC timings.  The timing effect on the input buffers is dependent on the Vil level:  •  Case 1: For signals driven with Vil < = 0.2V, the input timings will be unaffected.  •  For signals driven with 0.2V < Vil < = 0.4V, there may be as much as 0.5 ns degradation to input timings.  This issue applies only to 3.3V LVCMOS inputs or IOs used as inputs. Signals  operated at 1.8V are not affected.
Following a design issue on I/O muxing compiler, a glitch can occur on I/Os when switching them from the active mode to the off-mode override value.  The glitch is present:  •  if the feature for pin state override during off mode is used  CONTROL_(CORE/WKUP)_PAD0_X_PAD1_Y [25,9] OFFMODEENABLE = 1  •  and the override value CONTROL_(CORE/WKUP)_PAD0_X_PAD1_Y[27,11] OFFMODEOUTVALUE  = 1 and the IO value when going to off mode was 1.  There is no issue  •  if the override feature CONTROL_(CORE/WKUP)_PAD0_X_PAD1_Y[25,9] OFFMODEENABLE = 0 is  not used,  •  or if it is used to force a value which is different from the value before going to off mode.  •  or if it is used to force a 0 and the value before going to off mode was 0.
Not able to support single chip 32M x 16-bit (64 Mbyte total size) SDRAM devices or devices with a column address size of 10.
From the MIPI HSI spec; the transmitter shall be able to transmit a break transmission regardless of the state of the READY signal.  •  Break frame will not be sent if the READY line is low and Tx FIFO is not empty. Inserting a break frame, in this configuration, will also override a frame in Tx FIFO. Refer to "Break frame corrupt ongoing transfer" errata.  •  Break frame will be sent if TX FIFO is empty and READY line is low.
The PCI Express Specification is unclear regarding the transmission of Idle Symbols when a directed state transition occurs in the Recovery.Idle state. This can sometimes result in temporary loss of synchronization between link partners when transitioning from L0 to Detect, through the Disabled, Hot Reset, Configuration, or Loopback states. Section 4.2.6.4.4 of the PCI Express Specification states that Recovery.Idle Transmitter sends Idle data on all configured Lanes. Note: If directed to other states, Idle Symbols do not have to be sent before transitioning to the other states (that is, Disable, Hot Reset, Configuration, or Loopback). The PCI Express block chooses to send Idle symbols, as the specification does not prohibit the sending of Idle symbols.
Timing is not properly extracted for the boundary scan circuitry so  post-layout gate-level simulations did not correctly simulate the  circuit. A race condition prevents proper shifting of data through  the Boundary Scan circuitry.
DESCRIPTION
DISPC and RFBI are configured in smart-idle mode. After sending an image to the panel through the RFBI interface, the DISPC end-of-frame interrupt and RFBI end of transfer occur. After software sets the DSS in off state but no off state is not reached, DSS CM stays in idle transition, CM_DSS_DSS_CLKCTRL[17:16]  IDLEST = 0x1 because RFBI is not acknowledging idle request.
If TK is programmed as output and TF is programmed as input, it is impossible to emit data when start of edge (rising or falling) of synchro has a Start Delay equal to zero.
The PC_POE pin may cause system boot up failure when PCMCIA  interface buffer is connected directly. This is due to PC_POE pin  (muxed with NFCLE) driven low during initial boot (with/without NAND  Flash) which enables the external buffer and results in data bus  contention. This multiplexed signal can be re-programmed to perform  the PC_OE function after the system starts up, therefore, only boot  time is affected.
