The i.MX27/MX27L processor features the advanced and power-efficient ARM926EJ-S core operating at speeds up to 400 MHz, and is optimized for minimal power consumption using the most advanced

techniques for power saving (for example, DPTC, power gating, and clock gating). With 90 nm technology and dual Vt, the i.MX27/MX27L device provides the optimal performance vs. leakage current balance.

The performance of the i.MX27/MX27L processors are both boosted by an on-chip cache system, and

features peripheral devices, such as an MPEG-4, H.263, an H.264 video codec (up to D1—720 x 486—@

30 FPS), LCD, eMMA_lt, and CMOS Sensor Interface controllers.

The i.MX27/MX27L processors supports connections to various types of external memories, such as

266-MHz DDR, NAND Flash, NOR Flash, SDRAM, and SRAM. The i.MX27/MX27L devices can be

connected to a variety of external devices using technology, such as high-speed USBOTG 2.0, the

Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA), Multimedia/Secure Data (MMC/SDIO), and CompactFlash.

NOTE

The i.MX27L does not support the ATA-6 HDD interface.

ARM926 Microprocessor Core Platform

The ARM926 Platform consists of the ARM926EJ-S processor, ETM9, ETB9, a 6 × 3 Multi-Layer AHB

crossbar switch (MAX), and a “primary AHB” complex.

•

The instruction bus (I-AHB) of the ARM926EJ-S processor is connected directly to MAX Master

Port 0.

•

The data bus (D-AHB) of the ARM926EJ-S processor is connected directly to MAX Master Port 1.

Four alternate bus master interfaces are connected to MAX Master Ports 2–5. Three slave ports of the MAX are AHB-Lite compliant buses. Slave Port 0 is designated as the “primary” AHB. The primary AHB

is internal to the platform and has five slaves connected to it: the AITC interrupt module, the MCTL

memory controller, and two AIPI peripheral interface gaskets. Slave Ports 1 and 2 of the MAX are referred to as “secondary” AHBs. Each of the secondary AHB interfaces is only accessible off platform.

The ARM926EJ-S processor supports the 32-bit and 16-bit ARM Thumb instruction sets, enabling the user to trade off between high performance and high-code density. The ARM926EJ-S processor includes features for efficient execution of Java byte codes, providing Java performance similar to the just-in-time (JIT) compiler—which is a type of Java compiler—but without the associated code overhead.

The ARM926EJ-S processor supports the ARM debug architecture and includes logic to assist in both hardware and software debugging. The ARM926EJ-S processor has a Harvard cached architecture and

provides a complete high-performance processor subsystem, including the following:

•

An ARM9EJ-S integer core

•

A Memory Management Unit (MMU)

•

Separate instruction and data AMBA AHB bus interfaces

•

ETM and JTAG-based debug support

Functional Description and Application Information

The ARM926EJ-S processor provides support for external coprocessors enabling floating-point or other application-specific hardware acceleration to be added. The ARM926EJ-S processor implements ARM

architecture version 5TEJ.

The four alternate bus master ports on the ARM926 Platform, which are connected directly to master ports of the MAX, are designed to support connections to multiple AHB masters external to the platform. An external arbitration AHB control module is needed if multiple external masters are desired to share an ARM926 Platform alternate bus master port. However, the alternate bus master ports on the platform support seamless connection to a single master with no external interface logic required.

A primary AHB MUX (PAHBMUX) module performs address decoding, read data muxing, bus

watchdog, and other miscellaneous functions for the primary AHB within the platform. A clock control module (CLKCTL) is provided to support a power-conscious design methodology, as well as

implementation of several clock synchronization circuits.

2.1.1

Memory System

The ARM926EJ-S complex includes 16-Kbyte Instruction and 16-Kbyte Data caches. The embedded

45-Kbyte SRAM (VRAM) can be used to avoid external memory accesses or it can be used for

applications. There is also a 24-Kbyte ROM for bootstrap code.

Module Descriptions

This section provides a brief text description of all the modules included in the i.MX27/MX27L devices, arranged in alphabetical order.

2.3.1

1-Wire Module

The 1-Wire module provides bi-directional communication between the ARM926 core and the Add-Only Memory EPROM, DS2502. The 1-Kbit EPROM holds information about the battery and communicates

with the ARM926 Platform using the IP interface. Through the 1-Wire interface, the ARM926 acts as the bus master while the DS2502 device is the slave. The 1-Wire peripheral does not trigger interrupts; hence it is necessary for the ARM926 to poll the 1-Wire to manage the module. The 1-Wire uses an external pin to connect to the DS2502. Timing requirements are met in hardware with the help of a 1 MHz clock. The clock divider generates a 1 MHz clock that is used as a time reference by the state machine. Timing requirements are crucial for proper operation, and the 1-Wire state machine and the internal clock provide the necessary signal. The clock must be configured to approximately 1 MHz. You can then set the 1-Wire register to send and receive bits over the 1-Wire bus.

AHB-Lite IP Interface Module (AIPI)

The AIPI acts as an interface between the ARM Advanced High-performance Bus Lite. (AHB-Lite) and lower bandwidth peripherals conforming to the IP bus specification Rev 2.0. There are two AIPI modules in i.MX27/MX27L processors.

The following list summarizes the key features of the AIPI:

•

All peripheral read transactions require a minimum of two system clocks (R-AHB side) and all

write transactions require a minimum of three system clocks (R-AHB side).

•

The AIPI supports 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit IP bus peripherals. Byte, half word, and full word reads and writes are supported.

•

The AIPI supports multi-cycle accesses by providing 16-bit to 8-bit peripherals operations and

32-bit to both 16-bit and 8-bit peripherals operations.

•

The AIPI supports 31 external IP bus peripherals each with a 4-Kbyte memory map (a slot).

2.3.3

ARM926EJ-S Interrupt Controller (AITC)

The ARM926EJ-S Interrupt Controller (AITC) is a 32-bit peripheral that collects interrupt requests from up to 64 sources and provides an interface to the ARM926EJ-S core. The AITC includes software

controlled priority levels for normal interrupts.

2.3.4

ARM926EJ-S Platform

The ARM926EJ-S (ARM926) is a member of the ARM9 family of general-purpose microprocessors

targeted at multi-tasking applications. The ARM926 supports the 32-bit ARM and 16-bit Thumb

instructions sets. The ARM926 includes features for efficient execution of Java byte codes. A JTAG port is provided to support the ARM Debug Architecture, along with associated signals to support the ETM9

real-time trace module. The ARM926EJ-S is a Harvard cached architecture including an ARM9EJ-S

integer core, a Memory Management Unit (MMU), separate instruction and data AMBA AHB interfaces, separate instruction and data caches, and separate instruction and data tightly coupled memory (TCM) interfaces.

2.3.5

Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA)

The Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) host controller complies with the ATA/ATAPI-6

specification. The primary use of the ATA host controller is to interface with IDE hard disc drives and Advanced Technology Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI) optical disc drives. It interfaces with the ATA device over a number of ATA signals.

This host controller supports interface protocols as specified in ATA/ATAPI-6 standard, as follows:

•

PIO mode 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4

•

Multiword DMA mode 0, 1, and 2

•

Ultra DMA modes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 with bus clock of 50 MHz or higher

•

Ultra DMA mode 5 with bus clock of 80 MHz or higher

Before accessing the ATA bus, the host must program the timing parameters to be used on the ATA bus.

The timing parameters control the timing on the ATA bus. Most timing parameters are programmable as a number of clock cycles (1 to 255). Some are implied. All of the ATA device-internal registers are visible to users, and they are defined as mirror registers in ATA host controller. As specified in ATA/ATAPI-6

standard, all the features/functions are implemented by reading/writing to the device’s internal registers.

There are basically two protocols that can be active at the same time on the ATA bus, as follows:

•

The first and simplest protocol (PIO mode access) can be started at any time by the ARM926 to

the ATA bus. The PIO mode is a slow protocol, mainly intended to be used to program an ATA disc

drive, but also can be used to transfer data to/from the disc drive.

•

The second protocol is the DMA mode access. DMA mode is started by the ATA interface after

receiving a DMA request from the drive, and only if the ATA interface has been programmed to

accept the DMA request. In DMA mode, either multiword-DMA or ultra-DMA protocol is used

on the ATA bus. All transfers between FIFO and the host IP or DMA IP bus are zero wait states

transfer, so a high-speed transfer between FIFO and DMA/host bus is possible.

2.3.6

Digital Audio MUX (AUDMUX)

The Digital Audio MUX (AUDMUX) provides programmable interconnecting for voice, audio, and

synchronous data routing between host serial interfaces—for example, SSI, SAP, and peripheral serial interfaces—such as, audio and voice codecs. The AUDMUX allows audio system connectivity to be

modified through programming, as opposed to altering the design of the system into which the chip is designed. The design of the AUDMUX allows multiple simultaneous audio/voice/data flows between the ports in point-to-point or point-to-multipoint configurations.

Functional Description and Application Information

Included in the AUDMUX are two types of interfaces. The internal ports connect to the processor serial interfaces, and the external ports connect to off-chip audio devices and serial interfaces of other processors.

A desired connectivity is achieved by configuring the appropriate internal and external ports.

The module includes full 6-wire SSI interfaces for asynchronous receive and transmit, as well as a configurable 4-wire (synchronous) or 6-wire (asynchronous) peripheral interface. The AUDMUX allows each host interface to be connected to any other host or peripheral interface in a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint (network mode).

2.3.7

2.3.9

Configurable Serial Peripheral Interface (CSPI)

The Configurable Serial Peripheral Interface (CSPI) is used for fast data communication with fewer software interrupts. There are three CSPI modules in the i.MX27/MX27L processors, which provide a full-duplex synchronous serial interface, capable of interfacing to the SPI master and slave devices. CSPI1

and CSPI2 are master/slave configurable and include three chip selects to support multiple peripherals.

CSPI3 is only a master and has one chip-select signal. The transfer continuation function of the CSPI enables unlimited length data transfers using 32-bit wide by 8-entry FIFO for both TX and RX data DMA support.

The CSPI Ready (SPI_RDY) and Chip Select (SS) control signals enable fast data communication with fewer software interrupts. When the CSPI module is configured as a master, it uses a serial link to transfer data between the CSPI and an external device. A chip-enable signal and a clock signal are used to transfer data between these two devices. When the CSPI module is configured as a slave, the user can configure the CSPI Control register to match the external SPI master’s timing.

2.3.10

Direct Memory Access Controller (DMAC)

Functional Description and Application Information

Each module has individual control and configuration registers that are accessed via the IP interface, and are capable of bus mastering the AMBA bus to independently access system memory without any CPU

intervention. This enables each module to be used independently of each other, and enables the

pre-processor and post-processor modules to provide acceleration features for other software codec implementations and image processing software. These blocks work together to provide video

acceleration, and to off-load the CPU from computation intensive tasks. The PrP and PP can be used for generic video pre- and post-processing, such as scaling, resizing, and color space conversions. A 32-bit-to-64-bit AHB gasket is used to convert a PrP AHB bus from a 32-bit to 64-bit protocol. A bypass function is implemented to bypass this 64-bit gasket if it is not needed.

and statistics. The counters supported are the RMON (RFC 1757) Ethernet Statistics group and

some of the IEEE 802.3 counters.

2.3.14

General Purpose I/O Module (GPIO)

The general-purpose input/output (GPIO) module provides dedicated general-purpose pins that can be configured as either inputs or outputs. When it is configured as an output, you can write to an internal register to control the state driven on the output pin. When configured as an input, you can detect the state of the input by reading the state of an internal register. The GPIO includes all of the general purpose input/output logic necessary to drive a specific data to the pad and control the direction of the pad using registers in the GPIO module. The ARM926 is able to sample the status of the corresponding pads by reading the appropriate status register. The GPIO supports up to 32 interrupts and has the ability to identify interrupt edges as well as generate three active high interrupts.

2.3.15

General Purpose Timer (GPT)

The i.MX27/MX27L processors contains six identical 32-bit General Purpose Timers (GPT) with

programmable prescalers and compare and capture registers. Each timer’s counter value can be captured using an external event, and can be configured to trigger a capture event on the rising or/and falling edges of an input pulse. Each GPT can also generate an event on the TOUT pin, and an interrupt when the timer reaches a programmed value. Each GPT has an 11-bit prescaler that provides a programmable clock

frequency derived from multiple clock sources, including ipg_clk_32k, ipg_clk_perclk, ipg_clk_perclk/4, and external clock from the TIN pin. The counter has two operation modes: free-run and restart mode. The GPT can work in low-power mode.

2.3.16

Inter IC Communication (I2C)

Inter IC Communication (I2C) is a two-wire, bidirectional serial bus that provides a simple, efficient method of data exchange, minimizing the interconnection between devices. This bus is suitable for applications requiring occasional communications over a short distance between many devices. The flexible I2C enables additional devices to be connected to the bus for expansion and system development.

The I2C operates up to 400 kbps dependent on pad loading and timing. (For pad requirement details, refer to Phillips I2C Bus Specification, Version 2.1.) The I2C system is a true multiple-master bus, including arbitration and collision detection that prevents data corruption if multiple devices attempt to control the bus simultaneously. This feature supports complex applications with multiprocessor control and can be used for rapid testing and alignment of end products through external connections to an assembly-line computer.

2.3.17

IC Identification Module (IIM)

The IC Identification Module (IIM) provides an interface for reading and in some cases programming and/or overriding identification and control information stored in on-chip fuse elements. The module supports laser fuses (L-Fuses) or electrically-programmable poly fuses (e-Fuses) or both.

Multi-Master Memory Interface (M3IF)/M3IF-ESDCTL/MDDRC

Interface

The M3IF-ESDCTL/MDDRC interface is optimized and designed to reduce access latency by generating multiple accesses through the dedicated ESDCTL/MDDRC arbitration (MAB) module, which controls the access to and from the Enhanced SDRAM/MDDR memory controller. For the other port interfaces, the M3IF only arbitrates and forwards the master requests received through the Master Port Gasket (MPG) interface and M3IF Arbitration (M3A) module toward the respective memory controller. The masters that interface with the M3IF include the ARM Platform, FEC, LCDC, H.264, and the USB. The controllers are the ESDCTL/MDDRC, PCMCIA, NFC, and WEIM.

2.3.22

Multi-Layer AHB Crossbar Switch (MAX)

The ARM926EJ-S processor’s instruction and data buses—and all alternate bus master

interfaces—arbitrate for resources via a 6 × 34 Multi-Layer AHB Crossbar Switch (MAX). There are six (M0–M5) fully functional master ports and three (S0–S2) fully functional slave ports. The MAX is uni-directional. All master and slave ports are AHB-Lite compliant.

The design of the crossbar switch enables concurrent transactions to proceed from any master port to any slave port. That is, it is possible for all three slave ports to be active at the same time as a result of three independent master requests. If a particular slave port is simultaneously requested by more than one master port, arbitration logic exists inside the crossbar to allow the higher priority master port to be granted the bus, while stalling the other requestor(s) until that transaction has completed. The slave port arbitration i.MX27 and i.MX27L Data Sheet, Rev. 1.8

Functional Description and Application Information

schemes supported are fixed, programmable fixed, programmable default input port parking, and a round robin arbitration scheme.

The Crossbar Switch also monitors the ccm_br input (clock control module bus request), which requests a bus grant from all four slave ports. The priority of ccm_br is programmable and defaults to the highest priority. Upon receiving bus grants for all four output ports, the ccm_bg output will assert. At this point, the clock control and reset module (CRM) can turn off hclk and be assured there are no outstanding AHB

transactions in progress. Once the CRM is granted a port, no other master will receive a grant on that port until the CRM bus request (ccm_br) negates.

2.3.23

Memory Stick Host Controller (MSHC)

The Memory Stick Host Controller (MSHC) is located between the AIPI and the Sony Memory Stick and provides support for data transfers between the i.MX27 processor and the Memory Stick (MS). The MSHC

consists of two sub-modules; the MSHC gasket and the Sony Memory Stick Host Controller (SMSC). The SMSC module, which is the actual memory stick host controller, is compatible with Sony Memory Stick Ver 1.x and Memory Stick PRO. The gasket connects the AIPI IP bus to the SMSC interface to allow communication and data transfers via the IP Bus.

NOTE

The i.MX27L does not include the MSHC feature.

The MSHC gasket uses a reduced IP Bus interface that supports the IP bus read/write transfers that include a back-to-back read or write. DMA transfers also take place via the IP Bus interface.

A transfer can be initiated by the DMA or the host (through the AIPI) response to an MSHC DMA request or interrupt. The SMSC has two DMA address modes—a single address mode and a dual address mode.

The MSHC is set to dual-address mode for transfers with the DMA. In dual-address mode, when the

MSHC requests a transfer with the DMA request (XDRQ), the DMA will initiate a transfer to the MSHC.

NOTE

Details regarding the operation of the MSHC module can be found

separately in Memory Stick/Memory Stick PRO Host Controller IP

NAND Flash Controller (NFC)

NAND Flash Controller (NFC) interfaces standard NAND Flash devices to the i.MX27/MX27L

processors and hides the complexities of accessing the NAND Flash. It provides a glueless interface to both 8-bit and 16-bit NAND Flash parts with page sizes of 512 Bytes or 2 Kbytes. Its addressing scheme enables it to access flash devices of almost limitless capacity. The 2-Kbyte RAM buffer of the NAND

Flash is used as the boot RAM during a cold reset (if the i.MX27/MX27L device is configured for a boot to be carried out from the NAND Flash device). After the boot procedure completes, the RAM is available as buffer RAM. In addition, the NAND Flash controller provides an X16-bit and X32-bit interface to the AHB bus on the chip side, and an X8/X16 interface to the NAND Flash device on the external side.

Personal Computer Memory Card International Association

(PCMCIA)

The Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) provides the PCMCIA 2.1

standard, which defines the usage of memory and I/O devices as insertable and exchangeable peripherals for personal computers or PDAs. Examples of these types of devices include CompactFlash and WLAN

adapters.

The pcmcia_if host adapter module provides the control logic for PCMCIA socket interfaces, and requires some additional external analog power switching logic and buffering. The additional external buffers allow the pcmcia_if host adapter module to support one PCMCIA socket. The pcmcia_if shares its chip level I/O with the external interface to memory (EIM) pins. Additional logic is required to multiplex the EIM and the pcmcia_if on the same pins.

Digital Phase Lock Loop (DPLL)

Two on-chip Digital Phase Lock Loop (DPLLs) provide clock generation in digital and mixed

analog/digital chips designed for wireless communication and other applications. The DPLLs produce a high-frequency chip clock signals with a low frequency and phase jitter.

2.3.27

Pulse-Width Modulator (PWM)

The Pulse-Width Modulator (PWM) has a 16-bit counter and is optimized to generate sounds from stored sample audio images; it can also generate tones. The PWM uses 16-bit resolution and a 4 × 16 data FIFO

to generate sound. The 16-bit up-counter has a source selectable clock with 4 × 16 FIFO to minimize interrupt overhead. Clock-in frequency is controlled by a 12-bit prescaler for the division of a clock.

Capable of sound and melody generation, the PWM has an active-high or active-low configurable output, and can be programmed to be active in low-power and debug modes. The PWM can be programmed to

generate interrupts at compare and rollover events.

2.3.28

Real Time Clock (RTC)

The Real Time Clock (RTC) module maintains the system clock, provides stopwatch, alarm, and

interrupt functions, and supports the following features:

•

Full clock—days, hours, minutes, seconds

•

Minute countdown timer with interrupt

•

Programmable daily alarm with interrupt

•

Sampling timer with interrupt

•

Once-per-day, once-per-hour, once-per-minute, and once-per-second interrupts

•

Operation at 32.768 kHz or 32 kHz, or 38.4 kHz (determined by reference clock crystal)

The prescaler converts the incoming crystal reference clock to a 1 Hz signal, which is used to increment the seconds, minutes, hours, and days TOD counters. The alarm functions, when enabled, generate RTC

interrupts when the TOD settings reach programmed values. The sampling timer generates

fixed-frequency interrupts, and the minute stopwatch allows for efficient interrupts on very small boundaries.

The Run-Time Integrity Checker (RTIC) is one of the security components in the i.MX27/MX27L

processors. Its purpose is to ensure the integrity of the peripheral memory contents and assist with boot authentication. The RTIC has the ability to verify the memory contents during system boot and during run-time execution. If the memory contents at runtime fail to match the hash signature, an error in the security monitor is triggered.

Secure Digital Host Controller (SDHC)

The Secure Digital Host Controller (SDHC) controls the MultiMedia Card (MMC), Secure Digital (SD) memory, and I/O cards by sending commands to cards and performing data accesses to/from the cards. The Multimedia Card/Secure Digital Host (MMC/SD) module integrates both MMC support along with SD

memory and I/O functions. The SDHC is fully compatible with the MMC System Specification Version 3.0, as well as with the SD Memory Card Specification 1.0, and SD I/O Specification 1.0 with 1/4

channel(s). The maximum data rate in 4-bit mode is 100 Mbps. The SDHC uses a built-in programmable frequency counter for the SDHC bus, and provides a maskable hardware interrupt for an SDIO interrupt, internal status, and FIFO status. It has a pair of 32 × 16-bit data FIFO buffers built in.

The MultiMedia Card (MMC) is a universal, low-cost data storage and communication media that is

designed to cover a wide area of applications, including, for example, electronic toys, organizers, PDAs, and smart phones. The MMC communication is based on an advanced 7-pin serial bus designed to operate in a low-voltage range.

The Secure Digital Card (SD) is an evolution of MMC technology, with two additional pins in the form factor. It is specifically designed to meet the security, capacity, performance, and environment requirements inherent in newly emerging audio and video consumer electronic devices.

factor, pin assignment, and data transfer protocol are forward-compatible with the MultiMedia Card with some additions. Under SD, it can be categorized into Memory and I/O. The memory card invokes a

copyright protection mechanism that complies with the security of the SDMI standard, which is faster and provides the capability for a higher memory capacity. The I/O card provides high-speed data I/O with low-power consumption for mobile electronic devices.

Smart Liquid Crystal Display Controller Module (SLCDC)

The Smart Liquid Crystal Display Controller (SLCDC) module transfers data from the display memory buffer to the external display device. Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfers the data transparently with minimal software intervention. Bus utilization of the DMA is controllable and deterministic.

As cellular phone displays become larger and more colorful, demands on the processor increase. More CPU power is needed to render and manage the image. The role of the display controller is to reduce the CPU’s involvement in the transfer of data from memory to the display device so the CPU can concentrate on image rendering. DMA is used to optimize the transfer. Embedded control information needed by the display device is automatically read from a second buffer in system memory and inserted into the data stream at the proper time to completely eliminate the CPU’s role in the transfer.

A typical scenario for a cellular phone display is to have the display image rendered in main system memory. After the image is complete, the CPU triggers the SLCDC module to transfer the image to the display device. Image transfer is accomplished by burst DMA, which steals bus cycles from the CPU.

Cycle-stealing behavior is programmable so bus use is kept within predefined bounds. After the transfer is complete, a maskable interrupt is generated indicating the status. For animated displays, it is suggested that a two-buffer ping-pong scheme be implemented so that the DMA is fetching data from one buffer while the next image is rendered into the other.

Several display sizes and types are used in the various products that use the SLCDC. The SLCDC module has the capability of directly interfacing to the selected display devices. Both serial and parallel interfaces are supported. The SLCDC module only supports writes to the display controller. SLCDC read operations from the display controller are not supported.

2.3.34

Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI)

The Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) is a full-duplex serial port that allows the chip to communicate with a variety of serial devices. These serial devices can be standard codecs, Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), microprocessors, peripherals, and popular industry audio codecs that implement the inter-IC

sound bus standard (I2S) and Intel AC97 standard.

The SSI is typically used to transfer samples in a periodic manner. The SSI consists of independent transmitter and receiver sections with independent clock generation and frame synchronization.

The SSI contains independent (asynchronous) or shared (synchronous) transmit and receive sections with separate or shared internal/external clocks and frame syncs, operating in Master or Slave mode. The SSI can work in Normal mode operation using frame sync, and in Network mode operation allowing multiple devices to share the port with as many as thirty-two time slots.

The SSI provides two sets of Transmit and Receive FIFOs. Each of the four FIFOs is 8 × 24 bits. The two sets of Tx/RX FIFOs can be used in Network mode to provide two independent channels for transmission i.MX27 and i.MX27L Data Sheet, Rev. 1.8

and reception. It also has programmable data interface modes such as I2S, LSB, and MSB aligned and programmable word lengths. Other program options include frame sync, clock generation, and

programmable I2S modes (Master, Slave, or Normal). Oversampling clock, ccm_ssi_clk is available as output from SRCK in I2S Master mode.

In addition to AC97 support, the SSI has completely separate clock and frame sync selections for the receive and transmit sections. In the AC97 standard, the clock is taken from an external source and frame sync is generated internally. The SSI also has a programmable internal clock divider and Time Slot Mask registers for reduced CPU overhead (for Tx and RX both).

2.3.35

Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)

The i.MX27/MX27L processors contain six UART modules. Each UART module is capable of standard

RS-232 non-return-to-zero (NRZ) encoding format and IrDA-compatible infrared modes. The UART

provides serial communication capability with external devices through an RS-232 cable or through use of external circuitry that converts infrared signals to electrical signals (for reception); or it transforms electrical signals to signals that drive an infrared LED (for transmission) to provide low-speed IrDA compatibility.

The UART transmits and receives characters that are either 7 or 8 bits in length (program selectable). To transmit, data is written from the peripheral data bus to a 32-byte transmitter FIFO (TxFIFO). This data is passed to the shift register and shifted serially out on the transmitter pin (TXD). To receive, data is received serially from the receiver pin (RXD) and stored in a 32-half-word-deep receiver FIFO (RxFIFO). The received data is retrieved from the RxFIFO on the peripheral data bus. The RxFIFO and TxFIFO generate maskable interrupts as well as DMA requests when the data level in each of the FIFO reaches a

programmed threshold level.

The UART generates baud rates based on a programmable divisor and input clock. The UART also

contains programmable auto baud detection circuitry to receive 1 or 2 stop bits as well as odd, even, or no parity. The receiver detects framing errors, idle conditions, BREAK characters, parity errors, and overrun errors.

2.3.36

Universal Serial Bus (USB)

The i.MX27/MX27L processors provide three USB ports. The USB module provides high performance

USB On-The-Go (OTG) functionality, compliant with the USB 2.0 specification, the OTG supplement, and the ULPI 1.0 Low Pin Count specification. The module consists of three independent USB cores, each controlling one USB port.

In addition to the USB cores, the USB module provides for Transceiverless Link (TLL) operation on host Ports 1 and 2, and provides the ability of routing the OTG transceiver interface to Host Port 1 such that this transceiver can be used to communicate with a USB peripheral connected to Host Port 1. The USB

module has two connections to the CPU bus—one IP-bus connection for register accesses and one

AHB-bus connection for the DMA transfer of data to and from the FIFOs.

The USB module includes the following features:

•

Full Speed/Low speed Host only core (HOST 1)

•

Transceiverless Link Logic (TLL) for on board connection to a FS/LS USB peripheral

•

•

High-speed OTG core

The USB module has two main modes of operation: Normal mode and Bypass mode. Furthermore, the

USB interfaces can be configured for high-speed operation (480 Mbps) and/or full/low speed operation (12/1.5 Mbps). In Normal mode, each USB core controls its corresponding port. In additional to th4e major operational modes, each port can work in one or more modes, as follows:

PHY mode

In PHY mode, an external serial transceiver is connected to the port. This is used

for off-board USB connections.

TLL mode

In TLL mode, internal logic is enabled to emulate the functionality of two

back-to-back connected transceivers. This mode is typically used for on-board

USB connections to USB-capable peripherals.

Host Port 2 supports ULPI and Serial Transceivers. The OTG port requires a transceiver and is intended for off-board USB connections.

Serial Interface mode

In serial mode, a serial OTG transceiver must be connected. The port does not

support dedicated signals for OTG signaling. Instead, a transceiver with built-in

OTG registers must be used. Typically, the transceiver registers are accessible

over an I2C or SPI interface.

ULPI mode

In this mode, a ULPI transceiver is connected to the port pins to support

high-speed off board USB connection.

Bypass mode

Bypass mode affects the operation of the OTG port and Host Port 1. This mode is

only available when a serial transceiver is used on the OTG port, and the

peripheral device on Port 1 is using a TLL connection. Bypass mode is activated

by setting the bypass bit in the USBCONTROL register. In this mode, the USB

OTG port connections are internally routed to the USB Host 1 port, such that the

transceiver on the OTG port connects to a peripheral USB device on Host Port 1.

The OTG core and the Host 1 core are disconnected from their ports when bypass

is active.

Low Power mode

Each of the three USB cores has an associated power control module that is

controlled by the USB core and clocked on a 32-kHz clock. When a USB bus is

idle, the transceiver can be placed in low-power mode (suspend), after which the

clocks to the USB core can be stopped. The 32-kHz low power clock must remain

active as it is needed for walk-up detection.

2.3.37

Watchdog Timer Module (WDOG)

The Watchdog Timer module (WDOG) protects against system failures by providing a method of escaping from unexpected events or programming errors. Once the WDOG module is activated, it must be serviced by software on a periodic basis. If servicing does not take place, the timer times out. Upon a time-out, the WDOG Timer module either asserts the wdog signal or a system reset signal wdog_rst, depending on i.MX27 and i.MX27L Data Sheet, Rev. 1.8

2.3.38

Wireless External Interface Module (WEIM)

The Wireless External Interface Module (WEIM) handles the interface to devices external to the chip, including generation of chip selects, clocks and controls for external peripherals and memory. It provides asynchronous and synchronous access to devices with an SRAM-like interface.

The WEIM includes six chip selects for external devices, with two CS signals covering a range of 128 Mbytes, and the other four each covering a range of 32 Mbytes. The 128-Mbyte range can be

increased to 256 Mbytes when combined with the two signals. The WEIM offers selectable protection for each chip select as well as programmable data port size. There is a programmable wait-state generator for each chip select and support for Big Endian and Little Endian modes of operation per access.

2.3.39

Video Codec

The Video Codec module is the video processing module in the i.MX27 processor. It supports full duplex video codec with 25 fps VGA resolution, supports multi-party calls, and integrates multiple video processing standards, including H.264 BP, MPEG-4 SP, and H.263 P3 (including annex I, J, K, and T), D1

resolution, 30 fps—half-duplex.

NOTE

The Video Codec feature is not available on the i.MX27L

It has three 64-bit AHB-Lite master bus interfaces connecting to the EMI, which includes two read channels and one write channel. Its 32-bit AHB-Lite master bus is connected to ARM Platform to access system-internal SRAM.

The Video Codec module contains three major architectural components: video codec processing IP, AXI-to-AHB bus protocol transfer module, and a 32-bit to 64-bit AHB master bus protocol transfer module.

Power-Up Sequence

The i.MX27/MX27L processor consists of three major sets for power supply voltage named QVDD (core logic supply), FUSEVDD (analog supply for FUSEBOX), and NVDD VDDA (IO supply). The External

Voltage Regulators and power-on devices must provide the applications processor with a specific sequence of power and resets to ensure proper operation.

It is important that the applications processor power supplies be powered-up in a certain order to avoid unintentional fuse blown. QVDD should be powered up before FUSEVDD. The recommended order is:

1. QVDD(1.5 V)

2. FUSEVDD (1.8 V) NVDD (1.8/2.775 V), and Analog Supplies (2.775 V). See Table 3 for signal descriptions.

or

1. Q

(1.5 V), N

(1.8/2.775 V), and Analog Supplies (2.775 V). See Table 3 for signal VDD

VDD

descriptions.

2. FUSEVDD (1.8 V).

EMI Pins Multiplexing

This section discusses the multiplexing of EMI signals. The EMI signals’ multiplexing is done inside the EMI. Table 4 lists the i.MX27 pin names, pad types, and the memory devices’ equivalent pin names.

ATA Electrical Specifications

This section describes the electrical information of the Parallel ATA module compliant with ATA/ATAPI-6

specification.

NOTE

The parallel ATA module is not available on the i.MX27L

Parallel ATA module can work on PIO/Multi-Word DMA/Ultra DMA transfer modes. Each transfer mode

has different data transfer rate, Ultra DMA mode 4 data transfer rate is up to 100 MB/s. Parallel ATA module interface consist of a total of 29 pins, Some pins act on different function in different transfer mode. There are different requirements of timing relationships among the function pins conform with ATA/ATAPI-6 specification and these requirements are configurable by the ATA module registers.

Below defines the AC characteristics of all the interface signals on all data transfer modes.

Digital Audio Mux (AUDMUX)

The AUDMUX provides a programmable interconnect logic for voice, audio and data routing between

internal serial interfaces (SSI, SAP) and external serial interfaces (audio and voice codecs). The AC timing of AUDMUX external pins is hence governed by SSI and SAP modules. Please refer to their respective electrical specifications.

CMOS Sensor Interface (CSI)

This section describes the electrical information (AC timing) of the CSI.

4.2.5.1

Gated Clock Mode Timing

VSYNC, HSYNC, and PIXCLK signals are used in this mode. A frame starts with a rising/falling edge on VSYNC, then HSYNC goes high and holds for the entire line. The pixel clock is valid as long as HSYNC

is high. Figure 9 and Figure 10 depict the gated clock mode timings of CSI, and Table 21 lists the timing parameters.

The limitation on pixel clock rise time/fall time is not specified. It should be calculated from the hold time and setup time based on the following assumptions:

Rising-edge latch data:

max rise time allowed = (positive duty cycle—hold time)

max fall time allowed = (negative duty cycle—setup time)

In most of case, duty cycle is 50/50, therefore:

max rise time = (period/2—hold time)

max fall time = (period/2—setup time)

For example: Given pixel clock period = 10 ns, duty cycle = 50/50, hold time = 1 ns, setup time = 1 ns.

positive duty cycle = 10/2 = 5 ns

max rise time allowed = 5 –1 = 4 ns

negative duty cycle = 10/2 = 5 ns

max fall time allowed = 5 –1 = 4 ns

Falling-edge latch data:

max fall time allowed = (negative duty cycle—hold time)

max rise time allowed = (positive duty cycle—setup time)

4.2.5.2

Non-Gated Clock Mode Timing

In non-gated mode only, the VSYNC, and PIXCLK signals are used; the HSYNC signal is ignored. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the different clock edge timing of CSI and Sensor in Non-Gated Mode. Table 3 is the parameter value. Figure 11 and Figure 12 show the non-gated clock mode timings of CSI, and Table 22

Electrical Characteristics

4.3.1

Direct Memory Access Controller (DMAC)

After assertion of External DMA Request the DMA burst will start when the corresponding DMA channel becomes the current highest priority channel. The External DMA Request should be kept asserted until it is serviced by the DMAC. One External request will initiate at least one DMA burst.

The output External Grant signal from the DMAC is an active-low signal. This signal will be asserted during the time when a DMA burst is ongoing for an External DMA Request, when the following

conditions are true:

•

The DMA channel for which the DMA burst is ongoing has requested source as external DMA

Request (as per RSSR settings).

•

REN and CEN bit of this channel are set.

•

External DMA Request is asserted.

Once the grant is asserted the External DMA Request will not be sampled until completion of the DMA burst. The priority of the external request will become low, for the next consecutive burst, if another DMA request signal is asserted.

The waveforms are shown for the worst case—that is, smallest burst (1 byte read/write). Minimum and maximum timings for the External request and External grant signal are present in the data sheet.

Figure 15 shows the minimum time for which the External Grant signal remains asserted if External DMA request is de-asserted immediately after sensing grant signal active.

NAND Flash Controller Interface (NFC)

Figure 31, Figure 32, Figure 33, and Figure 34 show the relative timing requirements among different signals of the NFC at module level, and Table 35 lists the timing parameters. The NAND Flash Controller (NFC) timing parameters are based on the internal NFC clock generated by the Clock Controller module, where time T is the period of the NFC clock in ns. The relationship between the NFC clock and the external timing parameters of the NFC is provided in Table 35.

Table 35 also provides two examples of external timing parameters with NFC clock frequencies of 22.17 MHz and 33.25 MHz. Assuming a 266 MHz FCLK (CPU clock), NFCDIV should be set to

divide-by-12 to generate a 22.17 MHz NFC clock and divide-by-8 to generate a 33.25 MHz NFC clock.

The user should compare the parameters of the selected NAND Flash memory with the NFC external

timing parameters to determine the proper NFC clock. The maximum NFC clock allowed is 66 MHz. It should also be noted that the default NFC clock on power up is 16.63 MHz.

Note:

1 Timing parameters are relevant only to SDR SDRAM. For the specific DDR SDRAM data related timing parameters, see

Table 41 and Table 42.

NOTE

SDR SDRAM CLK parameters are being measured from the 50%

point—that is, high is defined as 50% of signal value and low is defined as

50% of signal value. SD1 + SD2 does not exceed 7.5 ns for 133 MHz.

The timing parameters are similar to the ones used in SDRAM data

sheets—that is, Table 37 indicates SDRAM requirements. All output signals are driven by the ESDCTL at the negative edge of SDCLK and the

parameters are measured at maximum memory frequency.

All the timings for the SSI are given for a non-inverted serial clock polarity (TSCKP/RSCKP = 0) and a non-inverted frame sync (TFSI/RFSI = 0). If the polarity of the clock and/or the frame sync have been inverted, all the timing remains valid by inverting the clock signal STCK/SRCK and/or

the frame sync STFS/SRFS shown in the tables and in the figures.

•

All timings are on AUDMUX pads when SSI is being used for data transfer.

•

“Tx” and “Rx” refer to the Transmit and Receive sections of the SSI.

•

For internal Frame Sync operation using external clock, the FS timing will be same as that of Tx Data (for example, during AC97 mode of operation).

Wireless External Interface Module (WEIM)

All WEIM output control signals may be asserted and deasserted by internal clock related to BCLK rising edge or falling edge according to corresponding assertion/negation control fields. Address always begins related to BCLK falling edge but may be ended both on rising and falling edge in muxed mode according to control register configuration. Output data begins related to BCLK rising edge except in muxed mode where both rising and falling edge may be used according to control register configuration. Input data, ECB and DTACK all captured according to BCLK rising edge time. Figure 53 shows the timing of the WEIM module, and Table 50 lists the timing parameters.

Pin Assignments (17 mm × 17 mm)

Table 59 on page 111 shows the i.MX27 full 17 × 17 mm package MAPBGA pin assignments.

Table 60 on page 116 identifies the pin assignments for the ball grid array (BGA) for full package. The list is sorted alphabetically by the name of the contact. The connections of these pins depend solely upon the user application, however there are a few factory test signals that are not used in a normal application.

Following is a list of these signals and how they are to be terminated for proper operation of the i.MX27/MX27L processor:

•

CLKMODE[1:0]: To ensure proper operation, leave these signals as no connects.

•

OSC26M_TEST: To ensure proper operation, leave this signal as no connect.

•

EXT_60M: To ensure proper operation, connect this signal to ground.

•

EXT_266M: To ensure proper operation, connect this signal to ground.

•

Most of the signals shown in Table 59 are multiplexed with other signals. For ease of reference, all of the signals at a particular pad are shown in the form of a compound signal name. Please refer to

Table 3 for complete information on the signal multiplexing schemes of these signals.

Pin Assignments (19 mm × 19 mm)

Table 61 shows the i.MX27 full 19 × 19 mm package MAPBGA pin assignment.

Table 62 identifies the pin assignments for the ball grid array (BGA) for full package. The connections of these pins depend solely upon the user application, however there are a few factory test signals that are not used in a normal application. Following is a list of these signals and how they are to be terminated for proper operation of the i.MX27/MX27L processor:

•

CLKMODE[1:0]: To ensure proper operation, leave these signals as no connects.

•

OSC26M_TEST: To ensure proper operation, leave this signal as no connect.

•

EXT_60M: To ensure proper operation, connect this signal to ground.

•

EXT_266M: To ensure proper operation, connect this signal to ground.

•

Most of the signals shown in Table 62 are multiplexed with other signals. For ease of reference, all of the signals at a particular pad are shown in the form of a compound signal name. Refer to Table 3

for complete information on the signal multiplexing schemes of these signals.
