This occurs using SPI with the following conditions: \xe2\x80\xa2 Master Mode \xe2\x80\xa2 CPOL = 1 and NCPHA = 0 \xe2\x80\xa2 Multiple chip selects are used with one transfer with Baud rate (SCBR) equal to 1 (i.e., when serial clock frequency equals the system clock frequency) and the other transfers set with SCBR are not equal to 1 \xe2\x80\xa2 Transmitting with the slowest chip select and then with the fastest one, then an additional on output SPCK during the second transfer. pulse is generated'

If the Flash is operating with one wait state, the frequency of the Master Clock MCK must be lower than 3 MHz or higher than 19 MHz. If the Flash is operating with two wait states, the frequency of the Master Clock MCK must be lower than 3 MHz or higher than 25 MHz. If the Flash is operating with three wait states, the frequency of the Master Clock MCK must be lower than 3 MHz or higher than 38 MHz. If these constraints are not respected, the correct operation of the system cannot be guaranteed and either data or prefetch abort might occur. The maximum operating frequencies (at 30 MHz @ 0 Wait States and 55 MHz @ 1 Wait State) as stated in Table 37-24, \xe2\x80\x9cEmbedded Flash Wait States,\xe2\x80\x9d on page 582, are still applicable.

S'Under certain rare circumstances, if the Watchdog Timer is used with the Watchdog Reset enabled (WDRSTEN set at 1), the Watchdog Timer may lock the device in a reset state when the user restarts the watchdog (WDDRSTT). The only way to recover from this state is a power-on reset. The issue depends on the values of WDD and WDV in the WDT_MR register.'
