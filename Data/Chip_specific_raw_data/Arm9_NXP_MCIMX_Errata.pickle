S'Description: Video Codec module supporting MV and MVD ranges does not conform with the H.264 standard. \xe2\x80\xa2The standard specifies the range of MVD to be \xe2\x80\x934096 to 4095.75. However, the Video Codec module only supports up to \xe2\x80\x932048\xe2\x80\x932047.75. \xe2\x80\xa2The standard specifies that the range of horizontal MV to be \xe2\x80\x932048 to 2047.75. However, the Video Codec module only supports up to \xe2\x80\x931024 to 1023.75. Because the maximum image resolution in the i.MX27 device is 720 \xc3\x97 576, it is not likely to receive a bitstream with MV/MVD in such a large range in real codec applications; therefore, there is no real impact to applications.'

In some instances, the host will not properly latch the K state. When this occurs, the core wakes up to a J state. Eventually the host will not resume, and will show an SE0 and assume a disconnect occurred.'

S'Description: During encoding or decoding MPEG-4, the Video Codec module can lock up. In the combined AXI to AHB and 32\xe2\x80\x9364 gasket, there is a FIFO for read data, which buffers data that is coming from the 64-bit bus faster than the 32-bit bus can accept it. There is no logic to send a request to memory only when the FIFO has room for return data. In a case with ideal data throughput, this FIFO overruns and read data is corrupted. This ideal data throughput only happens during MPEG-4 encoding and decoding.'

p74

S'Description:  The AUS bits in the WEIM Configuration Register (WCR) do not  work for the address bus bit A[23]. The WEIM address bus\xe2\x80\x99 most  significant bits (ADDR[25:16], Address Bus MSB) are used for  address bits [25:16]. If the corresponding AUSx bit (each WEIM  chip select has a corresponding AUS bit) is set to 1 in the WCR  register, then these MSB signals reflect the AHB address bits  [25:16]. If the AUSx bit is set to 0, then these signals should  represent AHB address bits [27:18] for word width memory,  [26:17] for half word width memory, and [25:16] for byte-width  memory. The error occurs when the AUSx bit is set to 1, which  causes the A[23] bit to not match the correct value of the  corresponding AHB address bit.  Reason:  This errata affects all Chip-Select regions (that is, CS0\xe2\x80\x93CS5).

S'Description:  End current burst (WAIT). This active-low input signal ECB is  asserted by external burst capable devices. It is serviced only in  synchronous mode (SYNC = 1).This signal can be used in the  following modes depending on the EW bit in the Chip Select  Control Register.  \xe2\x80\xa2 In the ECB mode (EW = 0), ECB indicates the end of the  current (continuous) burst sequence. Following assertion, the  WEIM terminates the current burst sequence and initiates a  new one.  \xe2\x80\xa2 In the WAIT mode (EW = 1), the memory device asserts this  signal to insert WAIT states during refresh collisions or during  a row boundary crossing. Following assertion, the WEIM does  not terminate the current burst sequence and continues it once  WAIT is negated.  FCE is a parameter in the register CSCRxA that is used to enable  or disable feedback clock:  \xe2\x80\xa2 If FCE = 0, WEIM samples the data by internal AHB bus clock.  \xe2\x80\xa2 If FCE = 1, WEIM samples the data by BCLK_FB signal that is  from PAD.  \xe2\x80\xa2 If FCE is configured to 1 and there is ECB assertion during  access, WEIM does not sample the correct data.

S' There are both a hardware and a software workaround. To  guarantee correct operation, the software workaround should  only be applied to devices that have had the new PLL test applied.  The test will be applied from a date code 1105:  \xe2\x80\xa2 Workaround 1\xe2\x80\x94Hardware:  Keep MPLLVDD < 200 mV during the initial part of the power-up  sequence and delay the MPLLVDD supply with respect to QVDD,  NVDD5, and AVDD. See Figure 1 for a recommended power-up  sequence. This workaround sets the uninitialized node to the  correct state enabling the appropriate 399 MHz clock output duty  cycle. For the clock switching errata workaround, the following  conditions must be satisfied:  \xe2\x80\x93 QVDD must be powered up before MPLLVDD.  \xe2\x80\x93 NVCC5 must be powered up before MPLLVDD. (This is  required for the POR_B signal to propagate to the clock  gating logic.)  \xe2\x80\x93 AVDD must be powered up before MPLLVDD. (This is  required for the POR_B signal to propagate to the clock  gating logic.)  \xe2\x80\x93 MPLLVDD must be driven to 0, not floating, before  powering up  A suggested delay circuit is described in Figure 2.  \xe2\x80\xa2 Workaround 2\xe2\x80\x94Software:  Originally for the ARM clock to work at 400 MHz, the MPLL is  configured for 800-MHz operating frequency at the 2x Clock Port  (see Figure 3 and code that follows the figure), and the DIV2  divider is selected by software to achieve the 400-MHz operating  frequency at the ARM core. The default 266-MHz frequency is  achieved by using the DIV3 divider with an 800-MHz frequency at  the 2x Clock Port (so 400-MHz MPLL frequency).  The intent of this workaround is to reconfigure the 2x Clock Port  to 1.2 GHz (600-MHz MPLL frequency), and continue to use the  DIV3 divider in order to achieve the 400-MHz operating  frequency. This avoids switching to the DIV2 divider, which  introduced the problem. '

The root  cause of this issue is due to an uninitialized node in the PLL, clock  gating, and divider circuitry, so the probability of this issue is  random. This error causes the ARM\xe2\x84\xa2 and DDR clocks duty cycle  to be 66% when they are running at 266 MHz and 75% when at  399 MHz, instead of 50%.  Projected Impact:  The result of the incorrect duty cycle of the clock is that the ARM  core might halt. This issue affects systems that enable 399 MHz  for the ARM core. '

S'Description:  A \xe2\x80\x9cwarm\xe2\x80\x9d reset is a reset initiated by a watchdog timeout,  RESET_IN, or by software forcing a reset via the watchdog  module. Such a reset will reconfigure all the CCM registers to  their default values but it will not restart the MPLL, so the full CCM  configuration defined by the registers does not take effect. In  particular, MCU_SEL is cleared, selecting the internal FPM  output. Changes to ARMSRC and ARMDIV also take immediate  effect. As a consequence, if the external high frequency reference  clock is slower than the internal FPM output, and the MPLL has  been configured to operate at 1.2 GHz, the MPLL will exceed the  specified limite of 1.2 GHz. For example: Given an external high  frequency clock of 24 MHz, a low frequency clock of 32 kHz, and  the MPLL configured for 1.2 GHz (MF=50) using the external  24-MHz clock as the reference, the following will occur: After a  warm reset, the MPLL will continue using MF=50, because the  CCM registers are reset to default values but the PLLs are not  restarted. As a result, the MPLL will lock to the FPM output  (32.768 MHz, selected by the default value of MCU_SEL in  CSCR), driving MPLL output frequency to 1.64 GHz, which is  beyond the specified maximum.
